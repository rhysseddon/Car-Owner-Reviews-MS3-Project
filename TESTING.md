## Fixed Bugs

- On the reviews accordions - the reviews that were longer than the width of the container
were spilling outside of their container instead of creating a new line. Was resolved by
using the Materialize class - `prewrap`.
Credit: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41081380/white-space-pre-not-working-as-expected)

- The wrong reviews and makes were getting deleted. I found this was due to the modal being 
within the jinja for loop, so added `modal{{loop.index}}` to the modal id so the modal id will 
 increment on each iteration of the jinja for loop.
