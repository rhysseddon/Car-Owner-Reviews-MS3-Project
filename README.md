## Purpose

The purpose of this website is to give users an insight into what it is like to own a particular car. 
Cars are one of the biggest purchases people make in their lives and they will normally want to make 
sure they are buying the right one!  
The website will be based on members submitting reviews of cars they own or have previously owned, 
this will give users an impartial view from people who have had the experience of owning the car and 
are not just trying to sell it for a profit.  
The reason for creating this project is for my third milestone project for a software development course
 I am undertaking with the Code Institute.

# UX

## Strategy

As the site owner my goal is to create a place for car owners to share their experience of owning a particular car and provide this information clearly to other users of the site.  To achieve this, I aim provide users with the ability to:
-	Add their own reviews.
-	Browse other users’ reviews.
-	Search other users’ reviews.
The target audience for the site will be:
-	Users that want to inform everyone of how good or bad their car is.
-	Users that are looking to buy a new car and require impartial information.
-	Users who have a general interest in cars.

### User Expectations

The user should:
-	Be able to navigate the site easily.
-	Expect the site to load quickly.
-	Read other users reviews.
-	Create, read, update and delete their own reviews.

## Scope

Based upon the strategy the features and functionality I want to include are as follows:
-	Car related hero image
-	A paragraph welcoming the user and explaining the websites purpose.
-	Ability to register, login and logout.
-	A search box where the user can search for reviews.
-	An accordion containing all the reviews so the user can browse through them.
-	An accordion containing the current profile owners’ reviews.
-	Ability for the user create, read, edit or delete their reviews.
-	A form for the user to fill out containing the make, model, year and review.
-	Ability for the user to rate the car from 0 to 5.
-	A form with the ability to edit make, model, year and review.
-	A page containing all the makes with options to delete or edit them for the admin user.

## Structure

The site will be structured in a linear format keeping the users’ expectations as the main priority. 
It will contain 8 pages each with the same navbar and footer. The layout will be similar across all pages 
to keep a consistent and clean UX.
