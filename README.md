# Car Owners Reviews

## Purpose

The purpose of this website is to give users an insight into what it is like to own a particular car. 
Cars are one of the biggest purchases people make in their lives and they will normally want to make 
sure they are buying the right one!  
The website will be based on members submitting reviews of cars they own or have previously owned, 
this will give users an impartial view from people who have had the experience of owning the car and 
are not just trying to sell it for a profit.  
The reason for creating this project is for my third milestone project for a software development course
 I am undertaking with the Code Institute.
