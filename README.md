## Purpose

The purpose of this website is to give users an insight into what it is like to own a particular car. 
Cars are one of the biggest purchases people make in their lives and they will normally want to make 
sure they are buying the right one!  
The website will be based on members submitting reviews of cars they own or have previously owned, 
this will give users an impartial view from people who have had the experience of owning the car and 
are not just trying to sell it for a profit.  
The reason for creating this project is for my third milestone project for a software development course
 I am undertaking with the Code Institute.

## User Stories

### Visiting users

As a visiting user I want to:
-	"Instantly understand the purpose of the website"
-	"Be able to swiftly decipher site navigation."
-	"Find out how good a particular car is?"
-	"Be able to register and become a member to post my own review."

### Returning users

As a returning user I would like to:
-	"Be able to login and see my profile."
-	"Be able to delete and edit my old reviews."
-	"Write a new review."
-	"Be able to log back out again."

### Admin users

As an admin user I require the ability to:
-   "Log in as an admin user."
-   "Delete or edit all member reviews."
-   "Search all members reviews."
-   "Create, edit and delete the makes of the cars"

# UX

## Strategy

As the site owner my goal is to create a place for car owners to share their experience of owning a particular car and provide this information clearly to other users of the site.  To achieve this, I aim provide users with the ability to:
-	Add their own reviews.
-	Browse other users’ reviews.
-	Search other users’ reviews.
The target audience for the site will be:
-	Users that want to inform everyone of how good or bad their car is.
-	Users that are looking to buy a new car and require impartial information.
-	Users who have a general interest in cars.

### User Expectations

The user should:
-	Be able to navigate the site easily.
-	Expect the site to load quickly.
-	Read other users reviews.
-	Create, read, update and delete their own reviews.

## Scope

Based upon the strategy the features and functionality I want to include are as follows:
-	Car related hero image
-	A paragraph welcoming the user and explaining the websites purpose.
-	Ability to register, login and logout.
-	A search box where the user can search for reviews.
-	An accordion containing all the reviews so the user can browse through them.
-	An accordion containing the current profile owners’ reviews.
-	Ability for the user create, read, edit or delete their reviews.
-	A form for the user to fill out containing the make, model, year and review.
-	Ability for the user to rate the car from 0 to 5.
-	A form with the ability to edit make, model, year and review.
-	A page containing all the makes with options to delete or edit them for the admin user.

## Database

To enable create read update an delete functionality the website will require a non-relational data base (No SQL).
The data base will have three collections:

### Users

A document of the registered users. 

Key | Value
---|---
_id |ObjectId  
username | string  
password | string

### Reviews

A document of reviews written by the users. Accessible by admin and partially by registered users. 

Key | Value
---|---
_id |ObjectId 
make | string
model | string
year | int
review | string
rating | int
owner | string

### Makes

A document of makes added by admin users. Only accessible by admin.

Key | Value
---|---
_id |ObjectId 
make | string


## Structure

The site will be structured in a linear format keeping the users’ expectations as the main priority. 
It will contain 8 pages each with the same navbar and footer. The layout will be similar across all pages 
to keep a consistent and clean UX.

## Deployment

### Setup
- In the IDE create an env.py file to store the sensitive data and hidden using environment variables.
- Create a .gitignore file for files to be ignored when pushing to gitHub.
- Add env.py file and auto generated `__pycache__/` file to the .gitignore file.
- Default environment variables setup for env.py is as follows:
- Import os
- *Blank Line*
- os.environ.setdefault("IP", "Added by user")
- os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "Added by user")
- os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "Added by user")
- os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "Added by user")
- os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "Added by user")

### Heroku Deployment

1. Add required files for Heroku to run the app. Create requirements.txt and Procfile:
- `$ pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- `$ echo web: python app.py > Procfile`
2. Push these 2 files to gitHub.
3. Login to Heroku.com and from dashboard go to "new" - "create new app" and add details of app to create.
